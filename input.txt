Compared to white students, students belonging to marginalized communities receive disproportionately inadequate and unequal education, which impacts their future success. Noah frequently notes the disproportionate education that black South Africans received under apartheid. He describes how "black children were forced into crowded classrooms in dilapidated schools often with teachers who were barely literate themselves" after most schools have been shut down (Noah 47). These conditions made it difficult for black South Africans to receive a quality education and hindered their opportunities for success. In the United States, the education system has also disproportionately impacted marginalized communities, particularly black and brown students. Black students in Indiana "graduate high school at lower rates and are less likely to go to college than their white peers" (Herron). This inequality in education leads to a disparity in outcomes for these groups, with black and brown students facing barriers to success in higher education and the job market. These barriers of unequal and inadequate education has long been obstructing the students of marginalized communities.
